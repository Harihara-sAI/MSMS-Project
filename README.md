# MSMS-Project
 The plastic classifier for the Smart Recycling Plant proposed the course project for the course titled "Modelling and Simulation of Manufacturing Systems". The notebook was initially run on Google Colab, which explains why the image directory has the words "drive" and "MyDrive" in it. The dataset was provided by Janusz Bobulski and Jacek Piatkowski from the Czestochowa University of Technology. Instructions and download links to download the dataset can be accessed from http://wadaba.pcz.pl/ . Out of all the images provided by them, only images having the parameters a01(PET), a02(PE-HD) and a05(PP) were used to train the model.
